How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It's quite easy to find difference between two files and these differences 
    can be the reason for bugs.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It can help check back and go back to old version easily

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: can control when to save, more logical
    Cons: can forget to commit, the save point may be inconsistent

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Some files may correlated with each other, it's good to commit together

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log can show all the commits
    git diff can compare files from two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can go back to any previous commits, so I will not worry about introducing
    bugs in new versions

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To manage my codes
